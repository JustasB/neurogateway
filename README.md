=========

A parallel wiring algorithm for parallel distance dependant wiring arbitary detailed morphologies. The algorithm was made to facilitate the study dynamic network changes corresponding to neurite atrophy and growth in time varying 3D neural networks. This model has been implemented as an extension of the Allen Brain SDK Utils class.


This model needs an installation of NEURON-7.3 configured to work with MPI and Python. Python must be able to use the NEURON module, and the NEURON must be able to call Python.
